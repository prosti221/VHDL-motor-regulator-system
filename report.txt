The biggest challenge has been keeping track of all the different modules and knowing where the problem is when debugging.
Another problem was towards the end when the behavior in simulation seemed completely normal, but when programmed on the zedboard it behaved incorrectly.
The motor also seems to not spin for values lower than around 80 on duty_cycle, not sure if this is supposed to be like this, couldn't not figure out how to change this.
However, when choosing values greater than 80, it behaves normally and seems to work as it should.
I decided to display the speed in hexadecimal as it seemed the simplest way since it didn't require any changes from the previous modules.
